## Description

Wander Wise is an ultimate travel companion for discovering and organizing travel destinations! This AI powered project helps users to explore locations through various filters, save and organize these locations, and interact with the community. Whether the locations are fetched from our database or generated by AI, Wander Wise aims to enhance user's travel planning experience.

### The Inspiration

At its core, Wander Wise was conceived to address the limitations of conventional travel platforms. We recognized that existing tools often lead travelers to well-trodden paths, missing the hidden gems that lie just off the beaten track.

### The Problems It Solves

- **Simplicity of Use:** Many people hesitate to travel independently due to the time-consuming planning process. Wander Wise allows users to apply filters and receive tailored travel suggestions with just a few clicks. Less planning, more travel!
- **New experience:** Every country, city, and even small town boasts hundreds of fascinating places. Unfortunately, only the most well-known destinations tend to be discovered by travelers. Wander Wise offers locations that popular travel lists often overlook.
- **Global Reach, Local Insights:** How often do people yearn to “go somewhere” on weekends? Just hop in a car to explore destinations within few hours of ride. Wander Wise offers this opportunity along with discovering far-flung locations across the globe.
- **Community:** It is often hard to find a good company for the trip. Wander Wise isn’t just an app, it’s a community of explorers. Users can create own locations, add cards to Saved, create custom collections, and plan trips collaboratively.

### The Mission 

The combination of features in Wander Wise opens up exciting possibilities. It could indeed evolve into a global social network for both experienced travelers and those seeking interesting vacations. Imagine a platform where users share their travel experiences, tips, and hidden gems from around the world.
